A deployable event management website, which could be used to organize events.It consist of two discrete pages: organiser and attendee. The organiser page is used to set up events and publish them. The attendee page is used to book published events. Additionally, I built this website and its database with security in mind by implementing a comprehensive authentication system which includes user registration, login
functionality, password hashing, session management, and protected route middleware.

##installation requirements##
* ExpressJS
* Express-session (for login session)
* bcrypt 

Additional notes:
*If website runs into unexpected error (which is highly unlikely), please do watch the video submission. It has the entire process and capabilities of my website listed. Thank you.
